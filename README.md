## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on:

1. Factorial Calculator API
- Description: A simple FastAPI application designed to compute the factorial of a given integer input, handling edge cases effectively.
- Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI
Key Features:
Provides a single endpoint (/factorial/{starting_number}) to calculate the factorial of an integer.
Uses a while loop for efficient factorial computation.
Returns results in JSON format.
Handles edge cases, such as input 0, correctly.

2. To-Do List CRUD API
- Description: A FastAPI-based CRUD API for managing tasks in a to-do list, supporting creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of tasks.
- Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI
Key Features:
Supports multiple endpoints:
GET /database/{task_id}: Retrieve a task by ID.
POST /database: Create a new task.
PATCH /database/{task_id}: Update an existing task.
DELETE /database/{task_id}: Delete a task by ID.
PUT /database/{task_id}: Replace an existing task.

Implements proper HTTP methods for task management.
Returns appropriate HTTP status codes for operations.

3. JSON Data Manipulation API
- Description: An API that integrates with JSONPlaceholder to retrieve and manipulate posts and comments, focusing on JSON data handling.
- Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI, Requests, JSON
Key Features:
Retrieves posts and comments from JSONPlaceholder API.
Formats data based on user or post IDs.
Implements an endpoint (/detailed_post/{userID}) to fetch all posts by a user and their associated comments.
Handles JSON parsing and conversion to Python data structures.

4. Versioned To-Do List API
- Description: A FastAPI application implementing a to-do list with API versioning, authentication, and proper error handling.
- Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, python-dotenv
Key Features:
Supports two API versions (apiv1 and apiv2) with identical CRUD functionality.
Implements API key authentication via headers or query parameters.
Uses Pydantic for input validation and proper HTTP status codes for error handling.
Stores API key securely using environment variables.

5. Cloud-Deployed To-Do List API
- Description: The to-do list API from Laboratory Activity 4, deployed to the Render cloud platform with versioning and authentication.
- Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, python-dotenv, Render
Key Features:
Deployed on Render with a public URL for accessibility.
Maintains versioning (apiv1 and apiv2) with CRUD operations.
Implements API key authentication and secure environment variable storage on Render.
Includes health check and welcome endpoints for monitoring and accessibility.
